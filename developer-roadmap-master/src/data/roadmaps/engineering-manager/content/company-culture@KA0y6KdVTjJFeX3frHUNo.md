# Company Culture

Company culture refers to the understanding and fostering of the values, beliefs, behaviors, and practices that make up the environment within a company. This encompasses how employees interact, the companyâ€™s mission, leadership style, policies, and work environment. Engineering managers play a crucial role in promoting company culture awareness by modeling desired behaviors, creating an inclusive and supportive team environment, and aligning engineering projects with the broader company values. They are also involved in hiring practices to ensure new team members fit with the company culture, implementing training programs to enhance cultural alignment, and providing feedback to ensure that the team's work environment supports productivity and employee satisfaction. By actively engaging in these practices, engineering managers help cultivate a positive and cohesive company culture that can drive organizational success.
