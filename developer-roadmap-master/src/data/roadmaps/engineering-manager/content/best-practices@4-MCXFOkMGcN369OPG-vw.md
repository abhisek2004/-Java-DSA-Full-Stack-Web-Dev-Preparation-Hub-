# Best Practices

Best practices at a company can encompass various areas such as project management, coding standards, operational processes, and staff engagement strategies. Documenting these practices is crucial as it ensures consistency in performance, aids in training new employees, provides a basis for evaluation and improvement, and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.

An engineering manager plays a pivotal role in documenting best practices by identifying the processes that work best, promoting a culture where documentation is valued, and ensuring the documentation is clear, accessible, and regularly updated. They can also facilitate feedback from team members to continuously refine these practices, ensuring they remain relevant and effective in meeting business goals.
