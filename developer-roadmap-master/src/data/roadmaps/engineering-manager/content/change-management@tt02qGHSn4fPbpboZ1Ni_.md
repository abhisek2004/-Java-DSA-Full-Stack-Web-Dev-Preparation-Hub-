# Change Management

Change management refers to the approach and processes used to ensure that significant changes are implemented in a controlled and systematic manner. Changes can include organizational restructuring, technology overhauls, strategy shifts, process reengineering, cultural transformations, and more. Engineering managers play a crucial role in this aspect, particularly when changes involve technical systems or processes. They are responsible for overseeing the planning, execution, and integration of new technologies or methods within their teams. Engineering managers also facilitate communication between technical staff and higher-level management to align engineering practices with broader organizational goals. Their involvement helps minimize disruptions and ensures that technical teams adopt new changes effectively, contributing to smoother transitions and the achievement of desired outcomes.
