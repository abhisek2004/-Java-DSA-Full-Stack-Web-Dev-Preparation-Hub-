# Budget Planning

Budget planning involves forecasting the financial resources needed to achieve strategic goals within a specific timeframe, often aligning with fiscal years or project timelines. Engineering managers play crucial roles in this process by estimating costs and resource needs specific to their projects, including personnel, hardware, software, and operational costs. They also help prioritize engineering projects based on organizational goals, potential ROI, and strategic importance. Additionally, engineering managers work closely with finance teams to ensure that their budget estimates align with financial constraints and organizational policies. Their input is essential for securing funding, managing risk, and ensuring that engineering projects are feasible and aligned with broader company objectives.
