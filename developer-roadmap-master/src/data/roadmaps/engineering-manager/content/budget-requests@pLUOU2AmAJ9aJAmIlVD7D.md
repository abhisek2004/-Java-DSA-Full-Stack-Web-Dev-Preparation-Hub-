# Budget requests

Budget requests in organizations are formal proposals for funding specific projects or operations. Engineering managers are often directly involved in this process, playing a crucial role in detailing the financial needs of their departments. They must justify the costs of personnel, equipment, and project expenses to align with the strategic goals of the company. The engineering manager's input is vital in forecasting accurate budgets that ensure the engineering team has all necessary resources for successful project execution without fiscal overruns. Their proposals are typically reviewed during budget meetings with senior management, where they must advocate for their departmentâ€™s needs effectively.
