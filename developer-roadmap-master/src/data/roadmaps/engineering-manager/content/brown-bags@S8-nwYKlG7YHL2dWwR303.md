# Brown Bags

Brown Bags are informal meetings typically held during lunch hours where employees share knowledge and learn about new topics in a casual setting. These sessions are often voluntarily led by an employee who presents on a subject matter of their expertise or recent project experiences, stimulating peer learning and knowledge sharing. Engineering Managers can facilitate these sessions by encouraging participation from various team members, ensuring a diverse range of topics that cater to the broader interests and developmental needs of the team. They can also provide logistical support by setting up appropriate meeting spaces and perhaps offering refreshments. Additionally, Engineering Managers can recognize and reward active participation and presentation efforts to promote a continuing culture of learning and information exchange within the team.
