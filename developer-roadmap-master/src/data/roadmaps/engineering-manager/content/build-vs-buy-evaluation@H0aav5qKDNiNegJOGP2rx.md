# Build vs Buy Evaluation

"Build vs Buy" evaluation is a decision-making process used by organizations to determine whether they should develop a new technological solution in-house ("build") or acquire an existing product from a third party ("buy"). This strategic decision involves considering factors such as cost, time, resources, competitive advantage, and alignment with business goals. Engineering managers play a pivotal role in this process. They assess the technical feasibility of building the solution internally, estimate development time and costs, and evaluate the technical merits of existing products. Furthermore, engineering managers must consider the long-term impacts on the engineering team, such as maintenance, scalability, and integration with existing systems. Their expertise and leadership are crucial in making an informed decision that aligns technological capabilities with business objectives.
