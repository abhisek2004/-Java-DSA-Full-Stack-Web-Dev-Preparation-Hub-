# Career Development Planning

Career Development Planning in a team is an essential process in which employees envision their future pathways in terms of career progression and set long- and short-term career goals. This planning involves skills development, educational opportunities, and the setting of career milestones aligned with both individual aspirations and business needs. Engineering managers play a crucial role in this area. They act as mentors and coaches, helping to identify each team member's strengths and areas for improvement, aligning project assignments with career aspirations, and facilitating access to necessary trainings or resources. Furthermore, they ensure that the development plan is mutually beneficial, supporting both the individual's career growth and the organizationâ€™s goals. This way, engineering managers help to increase job satisfaction and retention, while also promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the team.
