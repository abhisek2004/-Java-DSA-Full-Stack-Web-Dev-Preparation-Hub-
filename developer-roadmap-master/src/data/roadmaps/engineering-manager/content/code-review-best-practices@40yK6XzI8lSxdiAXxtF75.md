# Code Review Best Practices

Code review best practices involve systematic examinations of software source code intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked during initial development. These practices help ensure the code adheres to the agreed coding standards and is also structurally sound. Engineering managers play a crucial role in this process by defining and enforcing these best practices, facilitating efficient review processes, and integrating them into the software development life cycle. They might also be involved in training teams on effective code review techniques, selecting tools that aid the code review process, and analyzing code review data to ensure continuous improvement in code quality and team performance. Ultimately, engineering managers help create a culture that values the importance of code quality, peer collaboration, and continual learning and development.
