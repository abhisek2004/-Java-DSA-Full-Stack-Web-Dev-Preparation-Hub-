# Business Case Development

Business case development is a crucial process used to justify the initiation of a project or task, typically involving the assessment of financial and strategic costs and benefits alongside risk evaluations. This detailed evaluation helps key stakeholders understand the investments required and the potential returns or outcomes, enabling informed decision-making. Engineering managers play a vital role in this process, particularly in tech, manufacturing, and development projects. They contribute technical expertise and insights into operational impacts and resource requirements. Additionally, engineering managers help estimate timelines, budget needs, and the technical feasibility, ensuring the assumptions in the business case are grounded in practical realities. Their involvement is essential for aligning engineering capabilities with business objectives and for fostering an understanding among non-technical decision-makers of the technical challenges and solutions proposed within the business case.
